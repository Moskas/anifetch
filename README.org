* Building
** Nix/NixOS
If your system has ~nix~ you the repository is a flake you can build it with:
#+begin_src shell
nix build
#+end_src

** Linux/Windows/macOS
On systems without ~nix~ you need to have installed Rust and Openssl. Then you can build the application with:
#+begin_src shell
cargo build --release
#+end_src

The application was tested with Rust 1.77.2.
